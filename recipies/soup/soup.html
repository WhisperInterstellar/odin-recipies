      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>This is definitely not like the condensed canned stuff. It's much better!
          Great with a side of garlic bread. Chose whatever mushrooms and herbs are
          available in your area and appealing to you. Use fresh if you can get it
          for a richer flavor. Non-dairy substitutions are completely delicious, if
          you so chose!</p>
      <p><h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>16 oz mushrooms (variety) + enough oil/butter to saute</li>
              <li>2 tsp "any herb" (I like Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme)</li>
              <li>12 oz water</li>
              <li>8 oz sour cream + OPTIONAL flour to thicken</li>
              <li>Salt to taste</li>
          </ul></p>
        <p><h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prep</strong> by de-stemming and mincing heerbs as
                    nescesary and chopping mushrooms as you like them. If any of
                    your ingredients are dried, now would be the time to re-hydrate
                    them for a few minutes to improve flavor and texture.</li>
                <li><strong>In a pot</strong> coat bottom with oil and saute herbs
                    and mushrooms 5-10 min, until browned and aromatic.</li>
                <li><strong>Add</strong> salt and cover with 300ml (1.5cp) of water.
                    If you are unsure about the quantity of salt, test now with a
                    clean spoon and adjust to any preferences or health needs. Cover
                    with an apropriately sized lid.</li>
                <li><strong>Simmer</strong> over low heat for 30 min.</li>
                <li><strong>OPTIONAL</strong> for thicker soup, mix a few tbsp flour
                    and water until moist and a little runny. Then add that to the
                    sour cream.</li>
                <li><strong>Add</strong> dairy (or dairy mixture) in last few minutes
                    of cooking (5 or less)</li>
                <li><strong>Remove</strong> from heat. Once it is no longer scalding
                    hot, serve or store.</li>
        </ol></p>
