     <h3>Follow your rice cooker's instructions OR:</h3>
      <p>While it should be as common as a microwave or toaster, life
        isn't always that way. Not everyone has a rice cooker. For the
        sake of those who don't (which once included me), here is a
        rundown of how to get rice out of a pot with a tight fitting
        lid. This will make enough for 4 rice balls. I don't reccomend
        trying to make less, or to make more than 3 times as much.</p>
      <h2>You will need:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>about 240ml (1 cp) of uncooked short grain rice</li>
        <li>about 300ml (1.25 cp) of water</li>
        <li>! For "sushi" recipies, use about 5 to 10 percent less
          water, as there will need to be "room" in the rice for some
          liquid seasonings later.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Measure</strong> the rice and water. Ratio
      1:1.25</li>
      <li><strong>"Wash" </strong>the rice. put the rice in a bowl and 
        pour some running water in with it. Swirl it around to clean
        any dust or other residue from the grains' surfaces. Carefully
        pour out the cloudy water. Repeat this until the water is not
        particularly cloudy. It shouldn't take more than a few times
        to get clean enough, don't worry if it's not
        <em>perfectly</em> clear. After this, use a very clean towel
       (no softener or anything else you wouldn't want in your mouth!)
        or a large paper towel to get most of the remaining water out,
        possibly with some kind of strainer as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Soak.</strong> Put your cleaned rice and the
        water you measured earlier in a pot together and let it soak
        for about 20-30 minutes </li>
      <li><strong>Cover</strong> the pot <em>tightly,</em> if you
        haven't already. From this point on, do not remove the lid. 
        <strong>Do not!</strong> As much steam needs to stay inside as 
        possible!</li>
      <li><strong>Heat</strong> the pot over medium heat until you can 
        hear boiling.</li>
      <li><strong>Reduce heat</strong> to low and allow the rice to
        simmer for 12 to 13 minutes. The precise timing can vary based
        on humidity, temperature, elevation, air pressure, all sorts
        of things. But somewhere in that time frame should be close
        enough. If you smell something toasty before then, stop early.
        If you have a clear lid and can still see water bubbling in
        there, keep going.</li>
      <li><strong>Remove</strong> from heat and let it steam for 10
        more minutes. <em>Don't lift the lid until after this
        step.</em> I know it's hard, but do your best to trust the
        rice.
      <li><strong>Finally</strong> you can lift the lid now. Use 
        a spatula to fluff the rice and use or store it.</li>
        </ol>
