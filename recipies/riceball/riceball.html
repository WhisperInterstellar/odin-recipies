      <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
      <p> A great way to use up scraps from other recipies like 
        broccoli stems or part of a carrot. Just avoid oil or any 
        excess moisture, as it will keep the rice from forming a 
        shape.</p>
      <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
      <ul>
        <li>4 servings steamed short grain rice (240ml/1cp dry, see 
          link above)</li>
        <li>240ml (1cp) "Any Vegetable"</li>
      </ul>
      <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Any measuring/cuttiing/pre-cooking. Vegetables should be 
          broken down to pea-sized morsels and tender enough to bite 
          easily.
        <li>Be sure everything is cool enough to handle, fan/pat dry 
          for best rice adhesion.</li>
        <li>Mix rice and veg thouroughly. Use moistened clean hands to 
          press into fun shapes such as triangles.</li>
        <li>OPTIONAL: apply an edible wrap to help keep rice off hands 
          while eating. Try such options as nori (seaweed) or 
          tortillas (not the hard fried kind) or even lettuce. It's 
          yours to create and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
