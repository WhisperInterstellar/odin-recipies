      <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
  <p>If you've never had this, you need to have this. If you need to
    use a different sweetener, either choose a similarly syrupy one
    or combine a dry one with enough of something buttery to make a
    little ball of "paste" or "dough". Try finishing this sweet and
    simple treat with a little spice on top, such as cinnamon or
    powdered ginger.</p>
  <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p> 
      <ul>
    <li>4 crisp apples</li>
    <li> 120ml (1/2cp) honey, + more to drizzle</li>
      </ul>
      <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
      <ol>
  <li><strong>Preheat</strong> oven to 175°C (350°F) </li>
  <li><strong>Use</strong> a melon baller or small strong spoon to
    scoop out the cores from above. Leave the bottom of the apple
    alone so that your "honeypot" doesn't leak while baking. </li>
  <li><strong>Fill</strong> your apple's "honeypot" with 30 ml (2
    TBSP, or 1/8cp) of honey each. </li>
  <li><strong>Bake</strong> 15 min at 175°C (350°F), until tender.</li>
  <li><strong>Plate</strong> to serve. Drizzle more honey if you wish.</li>
      </ol>
<p><h4>It's ready to eat!</h4></p>
