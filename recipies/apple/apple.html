      <ul>
    <li>4 crisp apples</li>
    <li> 120ml (1/2cp) honey, + more to drizzle</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 175C (350F) </li>
  <li>Use a melon baller or small strong spoon to scoop out the cores 
    from above. Leave the bottom of the apple alone so that your 
    "honeypot" doesn't leak while baking. </li>
  <li> Fill your apple's "honeypot" with 30 ml (2 TBSP, or 1/8cp) of 
    honey. </li>
  <li>Bake 15 min at 175C (350F), until tender</li>
  <li>Plate to serve. Drizzle more honey if you wish. You could even 
    add some spices such as cinnamon. It's ready!</li>
      </ol>
