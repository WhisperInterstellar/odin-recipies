# odin-recipies

(Temporarily down, update:
  I know the links are broken. I'm trying to figure out what I'm doinn
  wrong so I can fix it.I knew this would happen if I moved the files,
  but I don't know why it won't let me change the href quote and save
  after. Thanks for your patience while I learn.)

This is a student project designed to demonstrate (and practice)
  all the skills I have learned so far, by using them. Specifically, I
  am meant to gather three recipies and make each one a web page that
  links back to (and is linked to by) an index. I need to give each a
  brief explaination, an unordered list of ingredients, an ordered
  list of steps, and a representitive image.

Personally, I also need to avoid getting ambitious out of a
  nervous need to "seem real." I need to work through the "fear of
  commit-ment." (haha) Seriously, I spent three hours trying to
  explain how to make sushi. I could be done by now instead, but I let 
  myself waste time being afraid I wasn't good enough. Come for the 
  career building skills, stay for the therapy, eh Odin-kin?
