# odin-recipies

What even goes in a README?

Is there a format to it? Is it simply a "Note from the author"
similar to at the start of a book?

I think I'll reurn to this at the end. I can intend the sun, the moon,
and all the stars, but it's much easier to explain a thing once it
exists.

What I do intend, though, is the following (in brief)

This is a student project designed to demonstrate (and practice) all
the skills I have learned so far, by using them. Specifically, I am
meant to gather three recipies and make each one a web page that links
back to (and is linked to by) an index. I need to give each a brief
explaination, an unordered list of ingredients, an ordered list of
steps, and a representitive image.

Personally, I also need to avoid getting ambitious out of a nervous
need to "seem real." I need to work through the "fear of commit-ment."
(haha) Seriously, I spent three hours trying to explain how to make
sushi. I could be done by now instead, but I let myself waste time
being afraid I wasn't good enough. Come for the career building skills,
stay for the therapy, eh Odin-kin?
